Surjeet Memorial College of Education was established in 2006, was a dream of S. Rajinder Singh Brar, Chairman of College Managing Committee that brought into reality by the untiring endeavor of S. Navjot Singh Brar, Secretary of College Managing Committee. College was granted recognition by National Council for Teacher Education, Jaipur and is affiliated to Panjab University, Chandigarh. Ours is the first Education College in Ferozepur which is self-financed and co-educational.

Initially, there was one unit of 100 B.Ed. students, subsequently one more unit of B.Ed  was added in 2008. College works under the guidance of renowned and seasoned educationist Dr. (Mrs.) Rajinder Sooch, Principal of the college.

This phenomenal rise clearly indicates the commitment of management and faculty which provides an environment of belongingness and value laden democratic work culture.</p>
